## 🛠️ Architectures & Implementations

One of the great advantages of using a general-purpose programming language like C# for home automations is the ability to introduce your own architectural patterns. This chapter highlights some of the patterns used in this example project.

### Automation Pipelines

This automation uses the [`AutomationPipelines`](https://github.com/DevJasperNL/CodeCasa.Libraries) library to handle complex logic in a modular, layered way.

Rather than implementing behavior directly in a single class, logic is split into small, independent pipeline nodes. Each node can contribute to or override the final outcome based on its own conditions. This makes the automation easier to reason about, test, and extend.

Below is the setup used in the `BackyardStringLightsPipeline` app:

```cs
backyardPorchStringLightsPipeline
    .SetDefault(false)
    .RegisterNode(new LightStringRoutineNode<bool>(scheduler, true, TimeSpan.Zero))
    .RegisterNode<BackyardStringLightsEnergySavingNode>()
    .SetOutputHandler(b => UpdateLightState(lightEntities.BackyardPorchStringLights, b));
```

In this example:
- The pipeline starts with a default state of false (lights off).
- The first node (LightStringRoutineNode) schedules the lights to turn on during morning and evening hours.
- The second node (`BackyardStringLightsEnergySavingNode`) can turn them off again if all curtains are closed.
- Finally, `SetOutputHandler` applies the resulting output to the actual light entity.

## 🔧 Projects Overview

### 🤖 Automations (`CodeCasa.Automations`)

This project contains the NetDaemon automations. It runs as a console application and can be hosted as a container.

### 📊 Blazor Dashboard (`CodeCasa.Dashboard`)

A Blazor-based web dashboard that demonstrates how to integrate with Home Assistant. This project showcases how to build responsive, interactive UIs that control and reflect your smart home’s state in real-time.

### 🧬 Auto-Generated Code (`CodeCasa.AutoGenerated`)

NetDaemon can auto-generate strongly-typed classes based on the entities in your Home Assistant configuration. For this demo, a curated selection of generated code is included to illustrate how this feature simplifies development and enhances type safety.

### 🛠️ NetDaemon Utilities (`CodeCasa.NetDaemon.Utilities`)

A collection of utility classes for working with NetDaemon entities. These utilities are tailored to the use-cases of this project but may be useful for similar implementations in other projects.
